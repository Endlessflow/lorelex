Task:
- Transform the reference text in the <reference> tag into clear, concise bullet points that will be used to create educational flashcards later. Pay particular attention to the key concepts and important principles in the text. Focus on identifying critical laws of physics, fundamental equations, and methods for solving statics and dynamics problems. Exclude historical and technical information. This information is trivial and doesn't contribute to the purpose of the educational materials, which is to help the student become proficient in physics.
- Each bullet point must be able to stand alone. Include the topic or principle of the bulleted statement somewhere in the text.
- Place all the bullet points in a plain text code block.
