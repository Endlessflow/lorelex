Task:
- Transform the reference text in the `<reference>` tag into clear, concise bullet points that will be used to create educational flashcards later. Pay particular attention to the key concepts and important principles in the text. Focus on identifying core principles of object-oriented design, crucial elements of UML notation, and methods for implementing design patterns. Exclude historical and technical information. This information doesn't contribute to the purpose of the educational materials, which is to help the student become proficient in object-oriented design.
- Each bullet point must be able to stand alone. Include the topic or principle of the bulleted statement somewhere in the text.
- Place all the bullet points in a plain text code block.
